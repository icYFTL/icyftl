# Hardcode, suffering and sometimes good ideas

`I am Saveliy [icYFTL] Pavlov`  

I don't like web at all. Really.  
C# is my life.  

Actually, I can write in many languages.  
Just give me a goal.  
(and money)  

Also like:  
* Soccer
* Docker
* CTFs
* GRPC

Also don't like:
* Low-level
* Bad specifications
* Jokes about semicolons and html
